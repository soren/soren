I am a versatile IT consultant with more than twenty-five years of professional experience. I have a wide range of competencies and like new challenges.

Professionally, and in somewhat prioritized order, I'm an AWS Solution Architect, a DevOps Engineer, a Full Stack Developer, a Computer generalist, a Linux User, a Perl Monger, a Pythonista, an Emacs Evangelist, and a Java Developer.
